Day 22 â€“ Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
Introduction:

Unsupervised learning identifies hidden structures in unlabeled data.

Objective:

To implement clustering algorithms like K-Means.

Procedure:

Using scikit-learn, I implemented K-Means and visualized clusters using Seaborn. Datasets were analyzed for pattern recognition.

Learning Outcome:

I learned to uncover hidden trends within datasets through clustering techniques.
