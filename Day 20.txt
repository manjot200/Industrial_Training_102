Day 20 â€“ Data Splitting and Model Training
Introduction:

Splitting data ensures model performance is evaluated objectively.

Objective:

To learn about dataset partitioning and model training using scikit-learn.

Procedure:

I used train_test_split() to divide data. Models like Linear Regression were trained and tested. Error metrics such as MAE and RMSE were introduced.

Learning Outcome:

I learned how to prepare data for training and evaluate performance effectively.
