Day 23 â€“ Model Evaluation and Optimization
Introduction:

Evaluating models ensures their accuracy and reliability.

Objective:

To assess model performance using validation metrics.

Procedure:

Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated. Cross-validation techniques were practiced for better model generalization.

Learning Outcome:

I learned to analyze model reliability using quantitative metrics and tuning.
