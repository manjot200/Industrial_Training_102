Day 12 â€“ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing in pandas
Introduction:

Raw datasets often contain missing or inconsistent values. Data cleaning ensures reliability and accuracy in analysis.

Objective:

To handle missing data, duplicates, and incorrect entries using pandas.

Procedure:

I used methods like dropna(), fillna(), and replace() to manage missing values. The drop_duplicates() and rename() methods were used for removing redundant data and renaming columns. The instructor demonstrated handling categorical data using astype() and pd.get_dummies(). A real-world dataset with missing entries was cleaned systematically.

Learning Outcome:

I learned the importance of preprocessing before analysis. Clean data directly improves the performance and reliability of machine learning models.
