Introduction:
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It emphasizes code readability and simplicity, which makes it an ideal language for beginners as well as professionals.

Key Features of Python:

  Simple Syntax: Easy to read and write, similar to English language.

Interpreted Language: Code is executed line by line, making debugging easier.

Portability: Python code can run on multiple operating systems like Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

Extensive Libraries: Supports libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Tkinter for various applications.

Versatility: Used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more.

Why Set Up an Environment?
Before starting Python programming, it is essential to install Python on the system and set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IDLE, VS Code, or PyCharm. An IDE provides a user-friendly interface to write, test, and debug Python programs efficiently.
Work Done:

Downloaded and installed the latest Python version from the official website (https://www.python.org/
).

Configured environment variables to run Python commands from the terminal or command prompt.

Installed Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the development environment.

Verified the installation by checking Python version in the terminal:
  print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
Learning / Observations:

Learned the importance of Python as a beginner-friendly programming language.

Understood how to install and configure Python on a computer.

Gained hands-on experience in setting up an IDE for coding.

Realized the role of an IDE in writing, running, and debugging programs efficiently.

Prepared the system environment for further Python programming tasks and project development.
