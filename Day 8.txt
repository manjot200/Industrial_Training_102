Day 8 – Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
Introduction:

Python provides several collection data types — tuples, sets, and dictionaries — that serve different purposes in data storage and retrieval.

Objective:

To understand immutable and unordered data structures and their role in data analysis.

Procedure:

Tuples were introduced as immutable sequences ideal for fixed data. Sets were used for operations like union, intersection, and difference, which are useful for handling unique elements. Dictionaries, being key-value pairs, were explained for mapping relationships between data. I created examples where dictionaries stored student data and product details. Comparison between these structures helped me understand when to use each efficiently.

Learning Outcome:

By mastering these structures, I learned to manage structured and unstructured data effectively. Dictionaries, in particular, became a crucial part of my data organization workflow.
