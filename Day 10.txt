Day 10 â€“ Advanced NumPy Operations
Introduction:

Building upon previous knowledge, this session explored more advanced features of NumPy, including multidimensional arrays and mathematical functions.

Objective:

To perform advanced numerical manipulations using NumPy methods and multidimensional data.

Procedure:

I created and manipulated 2D and 3D arrays using np.array() and np.reshape(). Operations such as element-wise computation, matrix inversion, and transposition were performed. The instructor explained broadcasting rules and aggregate functions like np.sum(), np.mean(), and np.std(). I also explored random number generation using np.random. Exercises involved data normalization and matrix computation.

Learning Outcome:

I became proficient in handling large, multidimensional datasets efficiently. Understanding broadcasting and aggregation enhanced my problem-solving approach in data science computations.
