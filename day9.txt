Day 9: Advanced NumPy Features
Introduction

Continuing with NumPy, today I focused on advanced features and functions. NumPy not only allows basic array creation but also provides powerful tools for mathematical, statistical, and logical operations.

Learning Highlights

Mathematical Functions
I explored NumPyâ€™s built-in mathematical functions, such as square root, exponential, logarithm, trigonometric functions, and more. These functions allow fast and accurate computation on arrays without writing loops.

Statistical Operations
NumPy can quickly compute statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, variance, and sum. This is particularly useful for analyzing datasets efficiently.

Array Manipulation
I learned that arrays can be reshaped, flattened, stacked, or split, which is helpful when preparing data for analysis or visualization.

Boolean and Conditional Operations
NumPy supports logical operations and conditional filtering on arrays, allowing extraction of elements that meet specific conditions without explicit loops.

Practical Applications
NumPy is essential in tasks such as:

Data preprocessing for machine learning

Performing simulations and scientific calculations

Generating synthetic data

Handling multidimensional datasets

Diary Note

Today I realized that NumPy is more than just arrays; it provides a complete framework for numerical and scientific computing. With its built-in functions and efficient operations, I can perform complex calculations on large datasets in a simple and optimized way. NumPy is truly a foundational library for data science and analytics.
