Day 16 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Introduction:

EDA is a critical step in any data science project that involves understanding data patterns and relationships before model building.

Objective:

To perform descriptive and visual analysis of datasets using pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Procedure:

I used methods like describe(), corr(), and value_counts() to generate insights. Heatmaps and pairplots visualized correlations among variables. Case studies such as student marks and sales trends were analyzed for dependencies and outliers.

Learning Outcome:

I learned how to derive meaningful insights from raw data through EDA, preparing datasets for predictive modeling.
