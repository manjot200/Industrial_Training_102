Day 24 â€“ Visualization of Machine Learning Results
Introduction:

Visualizing ML outputs enhances interpretability.

Objective:

To plot model performance and predictions.

Procedure:

Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and scatter plots were visualized using Matplotlib. Comparative charts between models were created.

Learning Outcome:

I learned how visual feedback assists in evaluating and improving model efficiency.
