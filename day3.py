Day 2: Python Syntax, Variables, and Data Types

Objective:

To understand the basic syntax rules of Python programming.

To learn how to declare and use variables.

To explore different data types in Python and their usage.

Introduction:
Python syntax refers to the set of rules that define how a Python program should be written and structured. Python is known for its clean and readable syntax, which makes programming simpler.

Key Points about Python Syntax:

Python does not require semicolons (;) at the end of statements.

Indentation (spaces or tabs) is used to define code blocks instead of braces {}.

Comments are written using the # symbol.

Variables in Python:

A variable is a name that stores data in memory.

Variables can be declared without specifying the data type explicitly because Python is dynamically typed.

Variable names should follow rules:

Start with a letter or underscore (_).

Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

Case-sensitive (e.g., Age and age are different).

Data Types in Python:
Python provides several built-in data types to store different kinds of information:

Numeric Types:

int → Integer numbers (e.g., 10, -5)

float → Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)

complex → Complex numbers (e.g., 2 + 3j)

Sequence Types:

str → String (e.g., "Hello, World!")

list → Ordered collection (e.g., [1, 2, 3])

tuple → Immutable ordered collection (e.g., (1, 2, 3))

Mapping Type:

dict → Key-value pairs (e.g., {"Name": "Manjot", "Age": 21})

Boolean Type:

bool → True or False

Work Done:

Learned Python syntax rules by writing simple programs.

Declared variables of different types and assigned values:

name = "Manjot"
age = 21
height = 5.9
is_student = True


Performed basic operations using variables:

sum_value = age + 10
greeting = "Hello " + name


Explored data types using the type() function:

print(type(name))      # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))       # <class 'int'>
print(type(height))    # <class 'float'>
print(type(is_student)) # <class 'bool'>


Practiced using lists and dictionaries to store multiple values.

Output:

Variables stored values correctly and operations returned expected results:

Hello Manjot
31
<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'bool'>


List and dictionary operations worked as expected:

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"]
print(fruits[0])   # Apple


Learning / Observations:

Python syntax is easy to read and write compared to other languages.

Variables are dynamic, no need to declare type explicitly.

Understanding data types is essential for storing and manipulating data.

Learned the importance of indentation for defining code blocks.

Practiced basic operations and data structure usage for further programming tasks.
